        <h2>Setting up the scene</h2>
        <p>
            This week, and going forward, we will be using a more standard and realistic hierarchy for managing all
            of our files. We will no longer be dumping all of the code into a single html file, but rather we will
            have the html file as an entry point with all our assests, math, and WebGL code in different files. Why
            does that matter? It matters quite a lot actually because modern browser security doesn't allow wesites
            to read from local files (which is where we have most of our code!). So how do we make it work then?
            Well, we'll have to run a local web server and serve those files to the frontend html file. There are many
            different options when it comes to servers, but I opted for the Node.js
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a> package. It takes almost no effort
            to get up and running!
        </p>
        <pre><code class="sh"># Install the http-server
npm install -g http-server</code></pre>
        <p>
            Then all you have to do to run the server is run the following command and point it to the directory that
            contains your <span class="eq">app.js</span> file.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="sh">http-server /path/to/dir</code></pre>

        <h2>Creating the ground</h2>
        <p>
            The first thing we want to do is to move the quad (which will be our ground) so that we can see it.
            Within the initial scene, both the camera and the quad have their world matricies set to the identitiy, so
            we can't see the quad at all because it's in front of the near plane. In order to see it we can either move
            the camera or the quad itself, and for right now we'll just concentrate on moving the quad. Since we are
            viewing the scene in a right handed cooridinate system, the camera is looking in the $-z$ direction. Let's
            start off by translating the quad away from the camera to $(0,\ 0,\ -10)$, and we get the following
            quad in the scene:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js"> groundGeometry.worldMatrix.makeTranslation(0, 0, -10);</code></pre>
        <div class="img-flex-wrap">
            <div class="img-grid-box">
                <img class="img-white-bg-card rec-450-300"
                     src="../../assets/img/wgli2_1_2.png"
                     alt="Translated square">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now that we can see the quad, let's work on positioning it to be the ground of the scene. To do this we
            want to rotate the quad so it lies in th $xz-plane$ and has it's normal along the $y-axis$. Given that
            it initially lies in the $xy-plane$ we want to rotate around the $x-axis$ by $90^{\circ}$. Now that it's
            in the right plane, we should scale it up by $10\times$ so that it takes up more space. One thing that's
            important to note is that if we leave the quad at the original translation of $(0,\ 0,\ -10)$ it will line
            up with the surface slice in the middle of the screen and be invisible. To remedy this it just needs to be
            translated down in the direction of the normal $(y-axis)$ by $-1$.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">// translate the quad so you can see it
let translation = new Matrix4().makeTranslation(0, -1, -10);
// rotate the quad to the xz-plane
let rotation = new Matrix4().makeRotationX(90);
// scale it horizaontally to make it "ground-like"
let scale = new Matrix4().makeScale(10, 0, 10);

// apply transformations in the order translate -> scale -> rotate
groundGeometry.worldMatrix.multiply(translation).multiply(scale).multiply(rotation);</code></pre>

        <h2>Adding the sphere</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have a ground plane let's add a sphere to our scene to make it more interesting. To do this
            we can use the data from <span class="eq">/data/sphere.json</span> that was loaded during the call to the
            <span class="eq">loadAssets()</span> function into the <span class="eq">loadedAssets.sphereJSON</span>
            variable. We will also need the <span class="eq">WebGLGeometryJSON</span> helper class to create and
            render the sphere. Behind the scenes what the <span class="eq">create()</span> function is doing
            is taking in the array of information for the verticies, normals, and face indicies and creating
            and binding gl buffers for each. Remember that gl buffers are buffers allocated in VRAM (on the graphics
            card itself). Then the <span class="eq">render()</span> function attaches the shaders, creates and binds
            the vertex position and normal attributes (for the <b><u>Vertex</u></b> shader), passes in the
            transformation
            matricies, and draws the geometry.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">// Create the sphere geometry from the loaded json data and the current gl context
sphereGeometry = new WebGLGeometryJSON(gl);
sphereGeometry.create(loadedAssets.sphereJSON);

// Render the sphere in our WebGL context with the camera object,
// projection matrix, and shader program
sphereGeometry.render(camera, projectionMatrix, colorProgram);</code></pre>
        <div class="img-flex-wrap">
            <div class="img-grid-box">
                <p>Initial sphere rendering</p>
                <img class="img-white-bg-card rec-450-300"
                     src="../../assets/img/wgli2_3_1.png"
                     alt="Gray ground plane">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            So if we just rendered a sphere why is the whole screen grey? Well, we didn't author this sphere ourselves
            and the sphere is much much to large for our scene out of the box and it is taking up the entire view
            volume.
            Also the sphere is grey as well as the ground because we are only passing a single color to the fragment
            shader (grey) so everything is coming out grey for now. So the question now is: How do we get the scene we
            want with a sphere on top of a plane? We just have to shrink the sphere by (quite) a bit and move it
            away from the camera. So let's scale it down to $\frac{1}{100}^{th}$ it's original size and translate it to
            $(0,\ 0,\ -5)$ (the middle of the ground).
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">// translate the sphere to the middle of the ground
translation.makeTranslation(0, 0, -5);
// scale it down so it doesn't take up the entire viewing volume
scale.makeScale(0.01, 0.01, 0.01);

// apply transformations in the order translate -> scale
groundGeometry.worldMatrix.multiply(translation).multiply(scale);</code></pre>

        <h2>Coloring the sphere</h2>
        <p>
            Right now the sphere is the same color as the ground beneath it, and it is difficult to tell that it's even
            a full sphere. Let's change the color of the sphere to something more defining against the ground.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">// Create a shade value (for convenience)
let shade = 1.0;

// Send the color values to the fragment shader
gl.uniform4f(colorProgram.uniforms.colorUniform, shade, shade, shade, 1.0);

// render the sphere
sphereGeometry.render(camera, projectionMatrix, colorProgram);</code></pre>

        <h2>Moving the Camera</h2>
        <p>
            Up until now, the camera for our scene has been static and set at the origin. Now it's time to make our
            scene more interactive by allowing the camera to move. First we need to find which direction is "forward"
            to the camera since later we'll be rotating it. To find this, we can think about how we define the world
            matrix: as a set of basis vectors, and we are really only concerned with the $3\times 3$ matrix of
            positional basis vectors starting with $W_{00}$.
        </p>
        <div class="eq latex latex-45">
            $$W =
            \begin{bmatrix}
            Right_{x} & Up_{x} & Forward_{x} \\
            Right_{y} & Up_{y} & Forward_{y} \\
            Right_{z} & Up_{z} & Forward_{z} \\
            \end{bmatrix}$$
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see in the matrix $W$, the "forward" direction of the camera is the $3^{rd}$ column vector
            from the world matrix. So we just want to grab that vector from world matrix and turn it into a Vector3
            object. But that's not quite what we want here since the camera is actually facing backwards, so the
            matrix really looks like this:
        </p>
        <div class="eq latex latex-45">
            $$W =
            \begin{bmatrix}
            Right_{x} & Up_{x} & Backwards_{x} \\
            Right_{y} & Up_{y} & Backwards_{y} \\
            Right_{z} & Up_{z} & Backwards_{z} \\
            \end{bmatrix}$$
        </div>
        <p>
            So to really get the forward direction, we just need to invert the backwards direction by multiplying
            thru by $-1$.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">this.getForward = function() {
    // pull out the forward direction from the world matrix and return as a vector
    // recall that the camera looks in the "backwards" direction
    let e = this.cameraWorldMatrix.elements;

    return new Vector3(e[2], e[7], e[10]).multiplyScalar(-1);
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now that we know which direction is forward with respect to the camera, we can start on translating the
            camera on keyboard input. To do this we will want to increment the <span class="eq">cameraPositon</span>
            variable within the camera's <span class="eq">update()</span> function bvy some small value. I chose to
            move by $0.02$ on each iteration, but it could stand to be a bit slower. One thing that also needs to be
            accounted for is when <u>neither</u> the up or down keys are being pressed because in the method I used,
            the camera position continually increases each key down frame then used as a translation on the camera's
            world matrix. So to rememdy this, we can add a third conditional and set the <span class="eq">cameraPositon</span>
            to $(0,\ 0,\ 0)$ so that the camera stops moving upon releasing both keys. One other possble approach to
            avoid using that third conditional might be to make a <span class="eq">new Matrix4</span> (thus set
            to the identitiy matrix), at the beginning of the function and then make the translation on it only upon
            the proper input.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">this.update = function(dt) {
    // Get the forward direction
    var currentForward = this.getForward();

    if (input.up) {
        // Move the camera position a little bit in its forward direction
        currentForward.multiplyScalar(0.02);
        this.cameraPosition.copy(currentForward);
    }

    if (input.down) {
        // Move the camera position a little bit in its backward direction
        currentForward.multiplyScalar(-0.02);
        this.cameraPosition.copy(currentForward);
    }


    if (!input.down && !input.up) {
        // Reset the camera position to avoid the camera never stopping
        this.cameraPosition.set(0, 0, 0);
    }

    ...

    // Create the cameraWorldMatrix from scratch based on this.cameraPosition
    this.cameraWorldMatrix.multiply(new Matrix4().makeTranslation(this.cameraPosition));

    ...

}</code></pre>

        <h2>Rotating the Camera</h2>
        <p>
            We just added a way to move the camera forward and backwards, but here we are going to add the ability to
            rotate the camera. To do this we need to update the <span class="eq">cameraYaw</span>, or the angle of
            rotation around the $y-axis$. Why are we rotating around the $y-axis$? Well, because the camera is
            positioned with its normal parallel to the $y-axis$. That's very important because if we tried rotating
            the camera around either the $x-axis$ or $z-axis$, we would be able to move the camera beneath the ground.
            Now that we know how to rotate the camera in a physical sense, let's take a look at the code for the
            completed <span class="eq">update()</span> function. We are going to rotate the camera in a very similar
            fashion to how we handled moving it. We will increment the <span class="eq">cameraYaw</span> by a small
            amount on either the left or right key being pressed, reset the <span class="eq">cameraYaw</span> upon
            neither being pressed, and then multiply the <span class="eq">cameraWorldMatrix</span> by a <br>
            <span class="eq">new Matrix4</span> with a rotation around the $y-axis$ by the <span class="eq">cameraYaw</span>.
            It's importat to remember that order matters here, and we want to translate the camera first and then rotate
            it.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">this.update = function(dt) {
    // Get the forward direction
    var currentForward = this.getForward();

    if (input.up) {
        // Move the camera position a little bit in its forward direction
        currentForward.multiplyScalar(0.02);
        this.cameraPosition.copy(currentForward);
    }

    if (input.down) {
        // Move the camera position a little bit in its backward direction
        currentForward.multiplyScalar(-0.02);
        this.cameraPosition.copy(currentForward);
    }

    if (!input.down && !input.up) {
        // Reset the camera position to avoid the camera moving endlessly
        this.cameraPosition.set(0, 0, 0);
    }

    if (input.left) {
        // Add a little bit to the current camera yaw
        this.cameraYaw += 0.001;
    }

    if (input.right) {
        // Subtract a little bit to the current camera yaw
        this.cameraYaw += 0.001;
    }


    if (!input.left && !input.right) {
        // Reset the camera yaw to avoid the camera spinning endlessly
        this.cameraYaw = 0.0;
    }

    // Order matters here!!! We want to translate -> rotate
    // Create the cameraWorldMatrix from scratch based on this.cameraPosition
    this.cameraWorldMatrix.multiply(new Matrix4().makeTranslation(this.cameraPosition));

        <h2>Animating the Sphere Color (Greyscale)</h2>
        <p>
            So far the sphere in our scene has just been a static color. First it was grey and now it's white. That's
            not a very interesting scene, so let's make it a bit more interesting by animating the color of the sphere.
            We can start by using grayscale and sending the same color value to each channel. To give it a smooth
            animation we can use a trig function (YAY!), the <span class="eq">time.secondsElapsedSinceStart</span> as
            the angle, and map the output to the range $[0,\ 1]$. I chose to use $sin()$ which maps to the range
            $[-1,\ 1]$. To get it into the $[0,\ 1]$ range, we can half the output and then add $\frac{1}{2}$.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">function updateAndRender() {

    ...

    // Animate the color of the sphere using greyscale
    let shade = Math.sin(time.secondsElapsedSinceStart) * 0.5 + 0.5;

    // Send the color to the fragment shader
    gl.uniform4f(colorProgram.uniforms.colorUniform, shade, shade, shade, 1.0);

        <h2>Fun With Color!</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have our color animated, let's play around with it a bit and find some different animations.
            The basic idea here is to still keep each channel within the $[0,\ 1]$ range, but not have the same value
            for each one so that we avoid greyscale colors (if possible).

    ...

    // Animate the color of the sphere
    let shade = Math.sin(time.secondsElapsedSinceStart) * 0.5 + 0.5;
    // For convenience set variables for each channel (besides alpha)
    let r, g, b;

    // Send the color to the fragment shader
    gl.uniform4f(colorProgram.uniforms.colorUniform, r, g, b, 1.0);

    ...
