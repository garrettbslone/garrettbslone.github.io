        <h2>Vectors in R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup></h2>
        <p>
            This week we learned about vectors in 2/3 dimensional space.
            We are taking a more geometric and physics based approach as opposed
            to an abstract mathematical approach.
            <br>
            What is a vector (in R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup>)? Well a vector is a displacement with
            some magnitude (length) and direction relative towards the coordinate axes.
            Since this vector is just this displacement,
            it can be translated anywhere in the coordinate system and be the same vector.

        <h2>Vector Addition</h2>
        <p>
            This definition becomes very useful for basic operations like adding two vectors together.
            This can be accomplished by placing the tail of one vector at the tip of the other and then drawing the
            vector that goes from the tail of the first o the tip of the second. Also, addition of these vectors is
            commutative meaning that <b><i>a</i></b> + <b><i>b</i></b> = <b><i>b</i></b> + <b><i>a</i></b>.

        <h2>Vector Scaling</h2>
        <p>
            Vectors can also be multiplied by scalars or scaled by some factor. This can done by multiplying the
            scalar through to each component, and is one way to help think about vector subtraction. You
            can scale a vector by negative on then add it to another vector meaning that
            <b><i>a</i></b> - <b><i>b</i></b> = <b><i>b</i></b> + (-1) * <b><i>a</i></b>.<br>

        <h2>Vector Length</h2>
        <p>
            The length of a vector, also called the magnitude, is the distance from the tail to the tip.
            This can be found using the Pythagorean theorem by making the vector itself the hypotenuse and
            each component another side of the triangle. This can the be expanded to three dimensions by
            adding a third component. The length is denoted as length(<b><i>a</i></b>) = ||<b><i>a</i></b>||.

        <h2>Vector Normalization and Unit Vectors</h2>
        <p>
            Vector normalization is the process of normalizing a vector or scaling that vector so that it has a
            length of 1. When this is done the resulting vector is called a unit vector which is denoted with a '^'
            over it, also called a 'hat'. This is done by scaling the vector by the reciprocal of the length
            meaning that the unit vector for som vector <b><i>a</i></b> = <b><i>a</i></b> * (1 / ||<b><i>a</i></b>||).
            This process is very useful for representing vectors in different coordinate spaces.

        <h2>Vector Dot Product and projection</h2>
        <p>
            The dot product is one of the multiplication-like operations that can be performed on two vectors.
            It takes two vectors and returns a scalar result. It can be performed by multiplying the components
            in a specific direction and summing all of them together. The formula looks like:
            <b><i>a</i></b> * <b><i>b</i></b> = a<sub>x</sub> * b<sub>x</sub> + a<sub>y</sub> * b<sub>y</sub>.
            Interestingly the length of a vector can be described as the square root of it dotted with itself meaning
            length(<b><i>a</i></b>) = sqrt(<b><i>a</i></b> * <b><i>a</i></b>). Vector projection is a way of
            expressing changing the direction of a vector to be parallel to another. In other words we can take a vector,
            say <b><i>a</i></b>, and project it onto (or in the direction of) another vector, say <b><i>b</i></b>.
            The resultant vector, lest call it <b><i>c</i></b>, has the same magnitude of <b><i>a</i></b> but
            is now in the direction of <b><i>b</i></b>. This can be done by multiplying <b><i>a</i></b> by
            a unit vector in the direction of <b><i>b</i></b>.
